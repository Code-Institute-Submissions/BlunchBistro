 The purpose of this project is to present a restaurant/bistro and to make it easy for 
the potential customer to find out some things about the bistro and concept also 
to be able to see the menu and to order from it.

## UX


This dashboard was designed to show information about the restaurant and the menu.

We try to bring more clients into the restaurant and also to increase the revenue 
through online order, delivery and takeaway. It's easy and convenient to call, book a table,
send an email and find the location through the navigation app.

## Wire Frames


I have included a few  images into this project that contain the wire frames [Here](assets/images/wireframe/image0.jpeg). 
[More](assets/images/wireframe/image2.jpeg), [More](assets/images/wireframe)
I attempted to stick to the design I made at first but made a few redesigns because i liked how it looked 


-----------------------------------------------------------

## Preview


The following link sends you to the preview of this website: [BlunchBistro](https://mihai-busuioc.github.io/BlunchBistro/)


-----------------------------------------------------------

## Technologyâ€™s:


### - HTML
 
This is the standard language for making websites.

### -CSS

In combination with Bootstrap I used my own CSS file to give the dashboard a personal touch.
This also allowed me to get the dashboard to work properly on all devices, and thave the look i was looking 
for.


### -JavaScript

JavaScript was used to make the shopping cart and the map.

### -Bootstrap
 
I used Bootstrap to give the 
dashboard a basic styling, supported with my own CSS files for a personal look.

-----------------------------------------------------------

## Layout


The layout for this dashboard is very basic, I have gone for a main image  layout with
 card elements that contain pictures of items from the restaurant and some Chef Recomandations . 
 For mobile I have chosen to make the cards one on top of the other 
due to the size of them. Due to this I have added a quick links into the footer  so that 
the user may change the page easier.

-----------------------------------------------------------

## Deployment:


As like my first project I have uploaded my project to Git-Hub for storage and deployment
due to the simple methods to do so. To upload to Git-Hub you first have to create 
a repository on Git-Hub then enter open the workplace on chrome through the gitpod.


- First i clicked on the project i wanted to have deployed.
- Then i selected settings and scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section in options.
- Here we must first select the source (the branch to be deployed).
- After selecting the source i saved it without choosing a theme.


The website address is: https://mihai-busuioc.github.io/BlunchBistro/

-----------------------------------------------------------



## Testing:


After finishing the coding i conducted tests on the dashboard through my mobile iphone 10x and samsung s10 , tablet(ipad pro) and 
desktop (Chrome, Safari and Edge) I also  tested the functionality via the chrome developer tools . The cart works as expected, it allows the user to add 
products, modify quantity delete them and order.

The code was tested and validated without errors on W3C for the HTML , the CSS passed through Jigsaw without issues
 and the JS passed through jshint.com linter without major issues. 


Most of my testing was done during development, i would do some coding then check how it would effect the dashboard
on the screen resolution i was trying to effect. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

## Contributions:


I found help as usual by searching the slack , stackoverflow.com, codeinstitute.net and 

#### -Dev Simplified


I watched their tutorial on the javascript and the cart is working as should because of that.

-----------------------------------------------------------

## Foot note


Iwould like to make known that all content in this dashboard is for learning purposes
 and will not be used for commercial use. I would also like to mention that due to some
  personal circumstances i wasn't able to do the commits more often and explicit as I should, 
  I would do it in the next project.
  Thank you
